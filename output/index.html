                     Message to 20-year-olds: don&rsquo;t wait 35 before starting an exercise routine. 3 or 4 times 30 mins per week is enough to maintain yourself. Ride bikes. Go swimming. Some body weight work. Switch from bar crawls to hiking trips once in a while.
You&rsquo;ll thank me in 15 years!

                     35. At 29 I was having constant pain in joints despite exercise. I would now say I&#039;m healthier than I was then because I learned HOW to exercise and what worked or didn&#039;t, when to push and when to rest. If you can learn your body and be disciplined, I would submit that the outcome is rewarding.

                         @sasquatched Looking at your state when you were 29: that happens if you start exercising pretty late. I was physically active since always, beginning with spritns and high jump in primary school, through handball and volleyball in secondary to boxing and gym in high school (and that stuck for good). Thanks to that when I got to exercise on my own I already knew bunch of exercises and proper way to perform them. Also, I knew when to stop. Only time my back and joints hurted was at the beginning of lockdown, when all gyms were closed, we weren&#039;t allowed to go out except for work and buying food and training mat I ordered didn&#039;t arrive yet.

                     Poor developers. But that&#039;s an issue in any software development.

                     Nobody is blaming the devs tho. People are blaming CDPR as a whole, and rightfully so.

                         @dank_programmer well the the cracks started to show during witcher 3 when they first reported about the bad work environment, then the Gwent disaster happened, now this. 
Cdpr is following the same path every company goes under capitalism.
(And before some wise ass thinks he&#039;s clever: no it&#039;s not capitalist in the same way communism under Russia wasn&#039;t communism, but I&#039;m not here to have a thoughtful discussion over definitions)

                         @balthaz ah yes the international jewry. One of the most well known Nazi conspiracies and still relevant. 
I suggest to look up &quot;the golden one&quot; on YouTube to see what kind of monsters propagate this lie
